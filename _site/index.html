									<td>Pimp Your Kimono</td>
									<td>Here at Mirage Garage two things that we prioritize is feeling and looking good, and there's no better way to achieve both than rocking a bangin' Kimono! Bring your Kimono or get one here produced by our in-house master seamstress and pimp it out. Prizes will be given for the most decked out Kimono, as judged by Xzibit himself!</td>

									<td>Sherpa Hunting</td>
									<td>Filling an entire corner of a plaza is no easy feat, and it takes a lot of manpower to put it all together. It's tough to recruit people for no pay to labor in the hot sun with no facilities the week before early entry, so here at the Garage we tell them they can camp with us all week as bait. However, we pull the ol' switcheroo and then kick them out right as they finish. This is a tried and true technique us New Yorkers learned from the great New York legend Trump himself! This leaves us in the position where we need to find new Sherpas to tear everything down, and that's where you come in! Whoever can bag the most Sherpas will receive a golden net and trident.</td>

									<th scope="row">Wednesday, 8PM-12PM</th>
									<td>Motor Oil Cocktail Hour</td>
									<td>Continuing with the theme of cars and garages, Mirage Garage is pleased to open up the camp bar to everyone for our Motor Oil Cocktail Hour. However, there is a twist... all the drinks contain real motor oil! Disposing of leaking oil on Playa is quite tricky, so we like to slip some into every drink so that we don't have to deal with getting rid of it. Heaven forbid we get another giant red mark on the Moop Map!</td>

									<td>Justify that Headdress Assistance</td>
                  <td>Everyone and their mother knows that you shouldn't wear a headdress on Playa, although everyone acknowledges how awesome they are. The general exception to this is that you can wear one if you can claim direct heritage. We're pleased to partner with Ancestry.com and 23andMe to find the most distant connection to you and someone in the distant past that was once able to wear a headdress. You might be a few dozen or hundred ancestors away, but we're confident in our ability to find or fudge that link!</td>

									<td>Psychottherapy sessions</td>
                  <td>Exploiting the lower classes, being relentlessly ruthless in your day to day interactions, and generally engaging in cutthroat capitalist activities really beats down on you mentally. That's why we had a licensed professional psychotherapist on site to help your justify your terrible behavior! Let that guilt go away so you can put that next business ploy in play. With the doctor in, there's no way you're not going to win!</td>

Mirage Garage is pleased to offer several stainless steel art cars for your convenience, which we affectionately refer to as the "Garbage Barge".

Instagram, created recently in 2010, had a trending hashtag of "#burningman", and one of the founders happened to see it in their feed after subscribing to the "#festival" tag. The founders were intrigued, and after talking to some folks they met at their Coachella Safari Campsite, they began their research in earnest.</p>

It needed to be more luxurious, exclusive, and trendy than the other neighboring, competing camps, so they enlisted the help of wealthy benefactors to turn their dreams into reality. They realized that building such a camp wasn't going to be cheap, and that bribing the Org to turn the other way wasn't free either, and had to reset expectations to bring their dream to the Playa for the following year.</p>

Featuring only forty air-conditioned tents, a Michelin star rated chef, and only one masseuse for the campers, the group toughed it out in the rugged conditions, and barely made it through. Things were so unprepared that two campers had to share the same costume box! The organizers vowed to never put their campers through such hardships again, and began to plan anew.</p>

With multiple art cars, public air conditioned spaces, an exhibition tent, an onsite photographer, public Wi-fi, and an army of hosts ready to cater to every campers needs, Mirage Garage stepped up its game to become THE destination on the Playa. There was even an event hosted on site that made it to the WWW!</p>

The southeast corner of that particular plaza was deemed to be less habitable for humans than usual after the Moop sweepers marked the entire area as red. Although the campers are sad to leave what they call home, it also means the beginning of a new journey, and since there's always room for more campers, that leads to the next phase of our story...</p>

Between all the beautiful head dresses walking around, the Day of the Dead face paint workshop, and pimp your Kimono sessions I just can't help but feel like I'm in this giant melting pot of beautiful people from all corners of the country. It feels like I grabbed the J train all the way from Greenwich Village to Queens and made a stop at every station! - Jonathan, Investment Banker, MAGA 2020</i></p>

Usually come August or Q4 I'm really stretching to come up with inspirational content for my Linkedin feed, but man oh man a day or two with the beautiful people at Mirage Garage really allows me to tap into the deepest parts of my soul to come up with amazing content. With camp internet access, I can post inspiring articles every day on my feed and my blog!

                            <p>Some of our campers just want to Burn with a nice feather mattress and hot shower to return to at the end of the day, and some just want to rage and get ratchet the entire time. This option is perfect for those that are planning on spending no time at camp and all of their time in front of the sound camps in a state of mind altered (high on life, of course!) bliss in an attempt to hit every DJ with an active Soundcloud playing and only need something portable to sustain them. The Mirage Garage branded backpack supplied is packed full of every stimulant and condensed food option you would need to last three days on the Playa without returning to base. We consulted with the top scientists at NASA to ensure that we didn't miss anything that you could need. Sunrise is coming up and you're miles away from a cup of coffee? No problem, sprinkle some of that pure caffeine powder into your Mirage Garage branded water bottle! Muscle tension from dancing all night and you haven't had the opportunity to stretch or rub one out in the portashitter yet? Nothing that our included packet of the most culturally appropriated Yoga stretches that we hand selected can't get you out of! Additional provisions can be purchased to refill the backpack onsite for varying fees, although note that purchasing an additional bag is prohibited as only one personal item is allowed.</p>

                            <p>It's been a rough year for some of our campers at other festivals. Some had to walk nearly two miles to see Kayne play at Coachella this past year, some had to get their own rides from the BRC Airport because the Pit Crew was too busy to pick them up, and some had to endure a less than a stellar experience at the Fyre Festival. Well have no fear! For those that were unlucky enough to NOT get a tent at Fyre this past year and had to rough it out on the beach with a bunch of sunburnt bros Mirage Garage is pleased to offer the FEMA tents that you missed out on! These tents were battle tested by attendees last year, and anyone that managed to secure one can attest to their luxury. Some of these are quite famous, having been featured in several documentaries. Each tent comes with a sopping wet mattress, which is quite the feat once you consider you're in the middle of a desert! Unfortunately, Ja Rule won't be onsite to escort you to your tent this time, but we did manage to find P-Diddy at the airport as a substitute.</p>

Here at the Garage, we're a sucker for anything that sort of fits in to the car or stainless steel theme, so we're pleased to offer an Airstream as an option. This bad boy gets polished each day by the Pit Crew so that it always looks fresh and more shiny than the pure silver plates that we use to serve our camp meals on (on which you'll be forced to serve at least one, so that we can claim that we're 100% participatory!). Various vintage Airstreams are available, so accommodations will vary depending on what year you find acceptable.</p>

Is it a dirty wook berating someone for not sharing water with them because they don't know that the Playa Provides? Or is it actually your luxurious housing for your time at the Burn? This room pays tribute to the great Mirage that our camp is partially named after. This room is so swanky that you'd be right in thinking that it is indeed a mirage. The BOrg apparently has also mistaken the entire complex for a mirage and convinced themselves that it doesn't exist, which is why it probably hasn't been shut down yet! This room comes with a hot tub with sand at the bottom for that authentic Desert Oasis experience, as well as palm trees providing shade.</p>

Our favorite garage of course is 2066 Crist Drive, home to the legendary business who managed to convince the world that buying an over-priced mass produced by exploited slave labor item made you a forward thinking creative genius. This campsite is modeled after that garage, although this one contains a King sized bed, a mini-bar, air conditioning, and a ten foot portrait of the great Jobs himself thinking different over the bed. Note that this unit does NOT have a medicine cabinet in it, although it comes with an unlimited supply of fruit smoothies.</p>
