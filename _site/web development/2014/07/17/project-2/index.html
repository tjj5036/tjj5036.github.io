Mirage Garage is pleased to offer several stainless steel art cars for your convenience, which we affectionately refer to as the "Garbage Barge". As a bonus, one is always positioned in front of camp, so you don't even have to leave camp to get the shot! Cars are left unlocked in the event you need to get to deep Playa and the chauffeur is not at camp.</p>

Pay no attention to the Sherpa passed out behind the shower exhausted from setting it up.</p>

Instagram, created recently in 2010, had a trending hashtag of "#burningman", and one of the founders happened to see it in their feed after subscribing to the "#festival" tag. The founders were intrigued, and after talking to some folks they met at their Coachella Safari Campsite, they began their research in earnest.</p>

It needed to be more luxurious, exclusive, and trendy than the other neighboring, competing camps, so they enlisted the help of wealthy benefactors to turn their dreams into reality. They realized that building such a camp wasn't going to be cheap, and that bribing the Org to turn the other way wasn't free either, and had to reset expectations to bring their dream to the Playa for the following year.</p>

Featuring only forty air-conditioned tents, a Michelin star rated chef, and only one masseuse for the campers, the group toughed it out in the rugged conditions, and barely made it through. Things were so unprepared that two campers had to share the same costume box! The organizers vowed to never put their campers through such hardships again, and began to plan anew.</p>

With multiple art cars, public air conditioned spaces, an exhibition tent, an onsite photographer, public Wi-fi, and an army of hosts ready to cater to every campers needs, Mirage Garage stepped up its game to become THE destination on the Playa.

The southeast corner of that particular plaza was deemed to be less habitable for humans than usual after the Moop sweepers marked the entire area as red. Although the campers are sad to leave what they call home, it also means the beginning of a new journey, and since there's always room for more campers, that leads to the next phase of our story...</p>

              <p class="large text-muted"><i>My favorite thing about Mirage Garage is the diversity. Between all the beautiful head dresses walking around, the Day of the Dead face paint workshop, and pimp your Kimono sessions I just can't help but feel like I'm in this giant melting pot of beautiful people from all corners of the country. It feels like I grabbed the J train all the way from Greenwich Village to Queens and made a stop at every station! - Jonathan, Investment Banker, MAGA 2020</i></p>
              <p class="large text-muted"><i>I've found that there's few other places on Earth that inspire me the same way that Mirage Garage does. Usually come August I'm really stretching to come up with inspirational content for my Linkedin feed, but man oh man a day or two with the beautiful people at Mirage Garage really allows me to tap into the deepest parts of my soul to come up with amazing content. With camp internet access, I can post inspiring articles every day on my feed and my blog! Be sure to connect on Linkedin and follow my Medium.com page! - Sandra, Fitness Instructor and Motivational Speaker</i></p>
              <p class="large text-muted"><i>Look, I'll cut straight to the chase with you, I camp with the Garage because there's a ton of beautiful bitches. Don't get me wrong, I have no shortage of that back home, but did you see the rack on that skank pouring drinks by the Smirnoff Fridge? Holy shit, am I right? Haha yeah give me a bump on that one. Oh...  nah fist bumps are cool, but I was talking about that Ketamine. - Chad, Los Angeles, Event Planner</i></p>
              <p class="large text-muted"><i>Let me put it this way: if we didn't have the Valyrian Steel (omg btw AMAZING NAME I love Game of Thrones LOL!) art car to help us get out of the slums and in front of the Temple my makeup would have looked like shit by the time we would have been ready for the shoot had we walked or used the elctric bikes. Gendry and his wrench monkeys go the distance to ensure that we look our best when getting the shot, and they even went above and beyond this past year by forcibly moving those grieving losers out of the way! - Arianna, Social Media Influencer, aspiring model, verified Instagram account holder</i></p>
